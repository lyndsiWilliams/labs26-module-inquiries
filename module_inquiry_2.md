# Module Inquiry 2

## Questions

1. What technical choices did you make today?
    - Front end: React, Redux, React Testing Library with Jest
    - Back end (if any): NodeJS
    - UX: Plotly, Ant.design
    - Deployment: Front - AWS Amplify, Back - Heroku
    - 3rd-party APIs: Google Places, Zillow, Census, WorldWeatherOnline API
2. Pick two technical choices you're happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against?
    2a. Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.
        - Redux - Powerful state-management system with one central data store
        - AWS Amplify - AWS is growing quickly in popularity and learning how to use this will be more impressive to potential employers
    2b. Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.
        - Redux - Not many disadvantages, other than a tedious setup
        - AWS Amplify - I have never used this service so I will be learning this fresh and be expected to implement it accurately. This could cause some unforseen issues, but from what I've seen so far, I don't think it will be hard to learn.
3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did.
    - We came to all these decisions together as a team, but the decisions were all unanimous - these will be the most efficient accepted technologies that we have available for this project.
4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process:
    - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?
        - A good technical choice is the best technologies that the team has available, but we must also take into account the technologies with which the team can work most efficiently.
