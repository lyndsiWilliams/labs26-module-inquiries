# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
    - What are the requirements for cities to be included in queries?
		- US cities over 50k, if you have more time then go for small towns. If 50k is too much, start with 100k
			- Add edge cases for major cities that need to be compartmentalized
	- What demographics should we focus on?
		- Rent, weather, job industry at first, add more as time goes on
	- How would you like the UI to look?
		- It's up to us, but it better be responsive
	- Would you like a user profile implemented?
        - Not now, but possibly in the future

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    - As a user, I can view the historical housing prices of a city.
    - As a user, I can view the historical population of a city.
    - As a user, I can compare multiple cities side-by-side.
    - As a user, I can view the major job industries in a city.
    - As a user, I can view the historical weather data for a city
    - As a user, I can search for a city by name

3a. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - As a user, I can search for a city by name
        - Build an API endpoint to respond to a query for city name with a City ID
        - Set up the database to connect names and IDs
        - Build a search form for city by name
        - All above the features have been tested and deployed

    3b. What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
    - I used my good communication skills to contribute ideas and discuss the details of implementing our user stories.

4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
    - I would read through the roadmap more closely so I don't miss any small details. I skimmed this one before mapping out the user stories and ended up backtracking once I read into details I accidentally skimmed over.
