# Module Inquiry 4

## Questions

1. Link to the pull request you are most proud of.

    - https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Labs26-Citrics-FE-TeamB/pull/6

2. Why are you proud of this feature? What was difficult about its implementation?

    - I'm proud of this because I have implemented the base search functionality for our search bar with dummy data. This is an important foundation for when we get the real data once data science provides us with an API with the real data.

3. How does this feature help the user?

    - This feature helps the user search for the city they'd like to learn about/compare with other cities.

4. Think about the process of delivering this feature: from ideation, to scoping, to pairing, to testing. Knowing what you know now, what would you change about the way in which you delivered this feature?

    - I don't think there's much I could change about how I approached this feature to make it better. It was simple search functionality, it didn't take long to implement and it works nicely. I haven't written tests for it yet, so I suppose that's the one thing I would change. Implement my testing earlier.
