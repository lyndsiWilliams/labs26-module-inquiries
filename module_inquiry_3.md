## Questions

1. What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?

    - Rachele Edwards and I worked on structuring the sidebar and it's search form.

2. When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?

    - I was the navigator while Rachele implemented the drawer from ant.design. I was the driver while typing out dummy state data for the search form and creating the ternary to hold the empty list. I think both roles were nice, I liked leading as the driver and plowing into the code and I liked sitting back and focusing on assisting with problem solving as Rachele took the lead.

3. What was difficult about being a navigator?

    - It's sometimes difficult at first to sit back and let somebody else drive, especially if you don't know them well and don't yet have a good communication connection set with that person. This peer programming session, however, went incredibly smoothly. Rachele and I work together great!

4. How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?

    - I will try to step back and stop taking charge too much. I have a strong personality and I sometimes worry that it might hinder others from speaking up with ideas, especially if I'm really fired up and blasting out some code.
